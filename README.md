## About the Video Course
Understanding essential React Native concepts and how it differs from React, can be difficult to translate into a working proof of concept. It is imperative to utilize your skills and knowledge in real-world projects in order to implement solutions when in the workplace or developing your own application.

This course aims to bridge the gap between the primary knowledge of React Native and its implementation. Focusing on developing several practical applications to handle issues such as navigation, state management, and UI/UX concerns.

You'll start by developing a Note application that uses Async storage to persist notes. Then learn how to fetch data and images from external APIs for your project and enhance your UI skills. Then finally, you'll learn how to perform effective state management and develop a useful project using the React Native for Windows framework.

By the end of this course, you will have gained the experience needed to make confident decisions when it comes to application development with React Native.
